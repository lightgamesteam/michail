Name of the project "Armada"
The project architecture was developed based on StangeIoC.

Armada consists of 2 parts
the first is the global game architecture and content display (Unity and StangeIoC)
the second is only the logical part

I want to show examples of the logical part.

Pattern Builder!

ShipSetupDataCommand.cs - example for create ship
Carpenter.cs - Director for ShipBuilder
ShipBuilder.cs - abstract class for Builder
SingleDeckShipBuilder.cs - concrete Builder
CoreShip.cs - product
